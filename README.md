![Download ArbModel](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-ArbModel-blue.svg)

## 🌟 Overview

ArbModel is an optimized reimplementation of the nuclear structure diagonalization code originally developed by S. Heinze in 2008. This tool integrates the Eigen C++ library to deliver fast symmetric matrix diagonalization, making it up to 100 times faster than previous versions. ArbModel is designed for researchers and professionals in nuclear physics, focusing on aspects like eigenvalues and eigenvectors related to the Interacting Boson Model (IBM) and nuclear deformation.
